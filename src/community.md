# Community Action

Urgent action is needed to protect our coastal marine ecologies from escalating threats such as climate change, invasive species, and biodiversity loss.

It is crucial that we build a stronger, more passionate voice to safeguard and rejuvenate these vital ecosystems for a flourishing future.

To achieve this, we must remove the barriers that hinder diverse participation in marine industries and conservation efforts. This includes creating more opportunities for women, people of colour, those without marine biology backgrounds, and individuals lacking significant funds.

Our goal is to cultivate and deepen the connection between coastal communities and marine ecologies, thereby accelerating action and elevating awareness of the critical challenges our oceans face.
