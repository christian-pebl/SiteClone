If you’re monitoring marine biodiversity in UK nearshore coastal environments, you already know how challenging these waters can be. Strong currents, shifting tidal ranges, and low light—especially during winter—make capturing reliable underwater footage a real test of both equipment and fieldcraft. As a Community Interest Company dedicated to delivering affordable, user-friendly marine monitoring solutions, our mission is to help researchers, conservationists, and industry professionals gather high-quality data in even the harshest tidal or offshore settings.

In this post, we’ll walk you through key considerations for selecting and deploying an underwater camera system, focusing on the demanding conditions of UK waters.

### **1\. Camera Durability for Rough UK Conditions**

####  **Material Considerations**

  * **Corrosion-Resistant Polymers**

    * Show absolutely no corrosion, making them an excellent choice for long-term immersion.

    * Minimal risk of galvanic corrosion when paired with metal fasteners of different compositions.

  * **Anodised Aluminium**

    * Sturdy and lightweight; however, anodised coatings can suffer from **galvanic corrosion** if used with mismatched metals (e.g., certain stainless-steel hardware). If you use anodised aluminium, ensure compatible hardware to minimise electrochemical reactions.

  * **Stainless Steel**

    * More corrosion-resistant than standard steels but can still corrode (especially in high-chloride saltwater). Look for 316-grade (or above) and ensure regular maintenance.

#### **Robust Seals: One Opening, Double O-Ring**

Look for camera housings that have **only one main opening** (e.g., a single hatch for memory card and battery access) with a **double O-ring seal**. This design significantly reduces the risk of leaks and simplifies inspection when you open and close the camera between deployments.

### **2\. Mounting Options in Tidal Environments**

With the UK’s high tidal variations, how you mount your camera matters just as much as the camera itself.   

#### **Manufacturer-Supplied Mounts**

Where possible, use **mounts or brackets provided by the camera manufacturer**. These are typically tested and optimised for the specific camera’s size, weight, and balance. Manufacturer mounts often come with the correct hardware to minimise vibration and movement in strong currents.   

#### **Seabed Frames (Landers, Observatory Platforms, or Sleds)**

  * **Pros** :

    * Excellent for benthic (seafloor) observations; can be positioned to study specific habitats.

    * Structures designed to handle a variety of sensors and cameras simultaneously.

  * **Cons** :

    * Must be anchored securely to resist strong currents.

    * Potential for sediment disturbance if placed incorrectly in high-flow areas.

#### **Floating/Surface Deployments**

  * **Pros** :

    * Camera stays near the surface, benefiting from more consistent light levels.

    * Commonly used for monitoring seaweed growth or shellfish production in aquaculture settings.

  * **Cons** :

    * Requires **rigid or tensioned mooring** (such as a large buoy or well-anchored aquaculture system). A small buoy might spin excessively under the weight of the camera, compromising the mooring and footage quality.

### **3\. Overcoming Visibility Challenges (Turbidity & Lighting)**

UK coastal waters often have high turbidity, especially after storms or heavy rainfall. Low winter sunlight further compounds these visibility issues.

####  **Low-Light Sensitivity Camera Sensors**

Choose a camera with large sensor size, sensitivity, dynamic range, low noise, and lens aperture to ensure clarity and detail in low-light conditions a wide range of ISO settings, large sensor and pixel size to handle variable low light conditions. **For a detailed guide on choosing the right camera sensor see this helpful article on**[** _low-light subsea imaging_**](https://fr.subcimaging.com/case-studies/why-its-important-to-have-underwater-low-light-environment-capabilities-in-a-subsea-camera)**.**   

#### **Subsea Lighting**

Built-in lights can produce excessive backscatter in turbid waters. Instead, opt for **external lights** mounted away from the camera lens.

Ensure your lighting setup has the adequate amount of Lumens for your deployment site and season (helpful article below)

####  **Using Optical Filters**

Certain filters (e.g., red or magenta for blue-green coastal waters) can help correct color balance underwater.  For more details on choosing optimal lighting and filters see[ _this comprehensive article on Subsea Lighting_](https://www.subcimaging.com/case-studies/a-guide-to-subsea-lighting).

### **4\. Balancing Budget with Scientific Accuracy**

Cost-effectiveness is crucial, but you also need reliable, scientifically valid data.

  * **Resolution Trade-Offs**

    * **4K** and **8K** resolution can capture incredible detail but generate massive file sizes. This can slow down workflows, consume storage, and make sharing footage difficult—especially if you’re deploying for weeks or months at a time.

    * Consider your data objectives. Often **1080p** (Full HD) is more than sufficient for species identification and behavioral studies.

### **5\. Pre-Deployment & Maintenance Checklist**

When you’re ready to head out to sea, a methodical approach can save time and protect your gear:

  1. **Check Mooring Redundancy**

     * Use both a clamp and a backup rope or tether. Ensure all hardware is compatible (no mismatched metals that could corrode or weaken connections through galvanic corrosion).   

  2. **Confirm Orientation & Field of View**

     * Is the camera facing the right direction?

     * Is your camera lens angled appropriately for the habitat or organism you’re studying?   

  3. **Assess Expected Visibility**

     * Research local conditions (turbidity, plankton blooms, etc.) or run preliminary tests.

     * Adjust your deployment schedule if extremely poor visibility is forecasted.   

  4. **Verify Power & Storage**

     * Ensure batteries are fully charged or that you have a sufficient external power source for longer deployments.

     * Check memory card capacity, especially if you’re using higher resolutions.   

  5. **Inspect O-Rings & Housing Seal**

     * Replace worn O-rings.

     * Lightly apply silicone grease (if compatible) to the O-rings for a perfect seal.   

  6. **Secure External Lights**

     * Confirm they’re mounted at an offset to minimise backscatter.

     * Check that power cables or battery packs are secured and watertight.

### **6\. Planning for Seasonality & Light Conditions**

In UK coastal waters, winter daylight hours are short, and overcast skies are common.

  * **Camera Lux Rating**

    * Ask the manufacturer for the lowest Lux level at which the camera can still produce clear images.

    * Compare that to estimated Lux levels at your site during different seasons.

**Simple Lux Estimation Formula**

  1. Assume surface Lux on a bright, sunny day might be ~100,000 Lux. (UK summer)

  2. Every meter of water depth can reduce light by 50% or more, depending on turbidity.

  3. Roughly calculate the expected Lux at your deployment depth and compare it to your camera’s minimum Lux requirement.
