Last year, the Ucheldre Community Centre rang with new ideas, warm laughter and the sea-salt stories of local residents who joined PEBL’s Coastal Community Leaders programme.

The Ucheldre Community Centre

Coastal communities are the heartbeat of local environmental change; ecosystem management is incomplete without those people with knowledge of an area’s history, understanding of its current struggles, and investment in its future. These two beliefs were what led to, and guided, our Coastal Community Leaders programme. 

Over the course of five workshops, we sought to equip participants with the skills needed to set up community initiatives or even launch new businesses, all while learning how to secure project funding and collaborate with inspiring local organisations and creative voices—from [_Project_](https://www.projectseagrass.org/sor-north-wales/) _Seagrass_ and [_North Wales Wildlife Trust_](https://www.northwaleswildlifetrust.org.uk/) to the [_Wild Oyster Project_](https://wild-oysters.org/) and campaigners from [_Save Penrhos_](https://bylines.cymru/environment/save-penrhos-nature-reserve/).

The workshops began with an introduction to human-centred design – physical and social structures that fill a human need in community spaces. Participants were then given the floor, encouraged to share their own histories with coastal ecosystems, and, through creative exercises, identify opportunities for community engagement. 

In latter sessions, we worked on developing practical skills in time management, project planning, and communication, guided by local experts. The final session covered organisational structures and funding, equipping future leaders to launch sustainable community initiatives. All resources delivered as part of the workshop series can be found [_here_](https://www.pebl-cic.co.uk/resources) on our website.

Twelve months later, we reached back out to participants and asked them what has stuck, what has grown, and what surprised them. Their reflections breathed fresh life into the programme—so here is an updated look, in their words as much as ours.

## **What they learned – and still use**

> “I finally saw how my ‘everyday’ skills—planning, listening, grafting fruit trees!—could carry across to any community project.” — Participant

  * ### Transferable skills & the planning cycle

Participants say they still open the simple planning template we explored in Session 2 when mapping new ideas.

  * ### Listening as leadership

One film-festival organiser told us that “hearing other perspectives” now shapes how she curates environmental shorts.

  * ### Confidence to try

Several respondents mentioned that the workshops pushed them past the “I’m not practical” mindset, inspiring them to join woodland-management days or botanical-garden digs.

## **Enduring connections**

###  Friendships forged over coffee breaks have become working partnerships

  * ### Local collaborations

Two alumni now swap volunteers between a coastal-clean-up group and a coppicing crew, sharing tools and social-media reach to maximise community engagement.

  * ### Idea Networks 

Funding tips, jargon busting and even contact lists still ping around a WhatsApp group set up on Day 1.

## **Out of the workshop room and into the community**

### **Theme**

####  Marine & Woodland 

#### Arts & Storytelling 

#### Education & Training

### **What's happening now?**

Alumni are grafting heritage fruit trees found on an archaeological dig and want to plant them at coastal schools next winter.

The Holyhead Film Festival team is using our stakeholder-mapping exercise to court new environmental sponsors.

One graduate hopes to become a community-skills trainer by 2026, bringing our time-management tools to a larger audience

## **Challenges faced and surmounted**

  * ###  Time 

Participants combat busy lives by managing their “project hours” and sharing calendars with family or co-leaders. 

  * ### Funding language 

Work in environmental films, for example, stalls when proposal language isn’t grasped by audiences. One participant laments, “I feel like I’m repeating myself.” Alumni now pair up to proof each other’s bids and swap glossaries of funder-friendly terms.

## **Happy surprises**

  * A shy attendee realised she loves public speaking after presenting her orchard idea, and now guest-lectures at the local college.

  * Several alumni discovered they were more interested in _woodland_ ecosystems than coastal ones, and that cross-habitat energy is fuelling fresh partnerships.

## **The six-month letters**

###  Hearing from their past selves

Every leader wrote a letter to their future self in the final session. When those envelopes arrived six months later, their messages hit home

> “I’d forgotten I wrote it. Opening it gave me the confidence kick I needed that week.”

Seeing early-stage hopes on paper reminded many alumni that progress beats perfection—a mindset still steering their projects today.

> “It clarified my need to work—and socialise—in my community.” — Participant

We can’t wait to see where the tide takes these leaders next.
